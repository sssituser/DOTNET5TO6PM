				Method

It is a self contained block of stmts which can be used to perform particular
task is called method.

or

It is set of instructions or stmts which can be used to perform a task.

Methods are of two types :
Predefined Methods :
	The methods which are present int the lib.
		Console.Write()
		Console.WriteLine()
		Console.Read();
		Console.ReadLine()
		ElementAt()
		IndexOf()
User defined methods : The methods which are defined by the developer can be called user defined methods.

In order to defin methods we should follow the given below syntax.

Access modifiers return type  MethodName(Parameters){

		stmts
		return ;
}

Accessmodifiers :  public static/public
		   private static/private
		   protected static/protected
		   internal static/internal

Return type : final result of a method, and are void,int,float,double,char,string
...class,Array

Method name : It should be meaningful name and It can be written in pascal case
naming convention.

Parameter : Parameters or arguments  of the methods are int,float,double,array,
class,void. Parameters of two types Actual parameters and Formal parameters.

Actual Parameters : The parameters which are given in method calling.

Formal Parameters : The parameters which are give in the method definition.

Advantages of the methods: 
			1.Define once and Reuse number of times(Reusability)
			2.Reduces code complexity.
			3.Application can be tested easily.

How to define the methods:
	public static int Square(int num){
	  return num*num;
	}
	public static int Sum(int num1,int num2){

	return num1+num2;
	}

	public static int Average(int num1,int num2,int num3){

		return (num1+num2+num3)/3;
	}

			:Error:

Errors are the mistakes in the program, mistakes will not allow the
application to execute or It may terminate the application abnormally

Errors are of two types
1.Compilation Errors : These errors can occur due missing syntaxes.
	Syntax errors are the examples of  compilation Errors.
	; }
	Solution :By provide proper syntaxes in the application

2.Runtime error  : These Errors can occur during execution, hence
these are called Runtime Error or Exceptions, these error or exceptions can cause abnormal termination of the application.

Exceptions are predefined classes which are inherited from Exception class
		Solution : In order to avoid abnormal termination 		of the application we use Exception Handling.

	Exception : The exceptions which are raised in the application need to be handled by using 
	1.try 
	2.catch 
	3.throw 
	4.finally

	try is a block  in which we write our code where we expect 
	an exception.
	try block alone can't handle the exceptions, Just it will 
	exception objects which are raised in the try block 	internally.
	try block must be followed with catch or finally block 	other	wise 	we get compilation Error.

	common catch block:
	Catch is a block which can catch all the exception objects which 	are raised in the try block.

	Individual catch block is block which can catch particular exception.
	We provide proper messages to the end user.




	catch blocks are of two types :
		common catch block : A catch block in which we Exception class
		can become a common catch block, such that it can handle all
		the exceptions.

				1.Itarative Statements
					or
				2.Loop Control Structures

These loops can be used to execute block of statements no of times based on the condition.
		1.While	: It is loop, It can be called as Entry Controlled structure.
Since It will check condition before execution of statements.

	syx:		While(booleanExpression)
			{

			 stmt(s);

			}

	case 1 : compiler checks Boolean expression  , if Boolean expression is false,
		 compiler will not while block stmts.

	case 2:Compiler checks BE, if the be true, compiler executes while block stmts,
	till the be reaches to false.
1.Write program to generate numbers from the given start and end values.
Examples
		start = 1	end = 10

		1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
		2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20

		given
			start = 1;
			end = 10;

			while(start <=  end){
				Console.WriteLine(start);
				start++;
			}

2.Write a program to find the reverse of the given number.
	num = 123		Reverse = 321

	steps:
		form the given number separate the digits num%10

	%    ---> Remainder
	/ ----->  quo
				10)123(12
		                   120
				-------
				     3
	123%10===> 3
	123/10 ===>12

	12%10  ===> 2
	12/10 ====> 1
	1%10 ===> 1
	1/10 ===>0

	3.Write a program to check given number is Palindrome or not?


	What is Palindrome ? Number and Its Reverse number if both are equal then number is said to
	be palindrome.


	Example: num = 456
		 reverse = 654

		456 != 654
	

	num = 456		ld = num%10 => ld = 6


	654
	num = num/10 ===>  num = 45 % 10  = 5
	num = 45 /10 ==>   num = 4%10    ld = 4

	
4.Write a program to generate numbers from 1 to n ?

5.Write a Program to find sum of   n numbers
n = 5		sum = 1+2+3+4+5  sum = 15


6.Write a Program to find the factorial of the given number
num = 4			Factorial = 1*2*3*4 => Factorial = 24

7.Write to program to find the factors of a given number

num = 10    factors : 1,2,5,10
num = 12    factors : 1,2,3,4,6,12

steps :
	1.I need generate the number from 1 to num
	2.we find the remainder with number from 1,2,3...num = 10

8.Write a program to check given number is prime or not ?

num = 17  since 2 factors given number is prime number

9.Write a program to check given number is Perfect or not
num = 6       1,2,3       => 1+2+3 => factsum = 6

1.Write a Program to check  given number is Armstrong or not ?
num = 153	1cube+5cube+3cube  1+125+27 => 153 
num = 1634	1pow4 +6pow4+3pow4+4pow4 = 1634

2.Write a program to check given number is Strong or not ?

num = 145   FactorialSum = 1!+4!+5!   => 1+24+120 => 145
Given number is a S
==============================================================================
				do{

				stmts;
				}while(con);

It is a controlled Structure, Since after executing do block at the end of the compiler checks
the condition, hence It a controlled Structure.

The difference between while and do-while in while if the condition is false compiler will not
execute the stmts, Where as in do-while even if the condition is false compiler executes do block
statements once.
